# AvailableExpressions-DFA
Available Expression Analysis for WHILE Language Programs

The Application Takes a WHILE Language Program Text File Location Path as an input and Generates a Report after performing Available Expressions Analysis on it. 

**Syntax Constraints:** 

-> The program shall only handle One Loop at a time.<br/>
-> The syntax of writing Programs should be in WHILE LANGUAGE.<br/>
-> The Application performs Available Expressions Data-Flow-Analysis.<br/>
-> The Program under analysis should declare, define, or initialize only one variable in one line.<br/>
-> The Application shall only be capable of taking Text Format files.<br/>
-> The Application shall not handle Nested Loops.<br/>
-> The Application shall not handle Functions.<br/>

_**File Path goes Here**_<br/>
_Path should be in the form of 'D:\Projects\EclipseProjects\Data-Flow-Analysis-File - Loop\Files\TestLoop3.txt'_
